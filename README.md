# Machine Learning Showcase

This repository is a collection of various machine learning projects implemented in Python using scikit-learn and pandas.

## Projects

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Clustering**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**


Each project is a standalone code dump showcasing different machine learning concepts and algorithms that I learned.
